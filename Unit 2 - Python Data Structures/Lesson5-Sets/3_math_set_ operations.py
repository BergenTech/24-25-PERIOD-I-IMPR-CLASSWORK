# Mathematical Set Operations Reference
# ------------------------------------
# A ∪ B (Union):         A.union(B)        or  A | B
# A ∩ B (Intersection):  A.intersection(B)  or  A & B
# A - B (Difference):    A.difference(B)    or  A - B
# A △ B (Symmetric Diff): A.symmetric_difference(B) or A ^ B

# Problem: A school survey asked students about their favorite sports
# sets for students who like different sports
basketball_fans = {"Emma", "Noah", "Olivia", "Liam", "Ava", "Mason", "Sophia", "Jacob"}
soccer_fans = {"Noah", "Olivia", "Ethan", "Charlotte", "William", "Sophia", "James", "Amelia"}

# Display the original sets
print("Students who like basketball:", basketball_fans)
print("Students who like soccer:", soccer_fans)
print()


# Operation 1: Find students who like both basketball AND soccer (intersection)
# Write your code below:
# basketball_and_soccer =

print("INTERSECTION (∩)")
print("Students who like both basketball AND soccer: [Your answer here]")
print()

# Operation 2: Find students who like basketball OR soccer (union)
# Write your code below:
# basketball_or_soccer =

print("UNION (∪)")
print("Students who like either basketball OR soccer (or both): [Your answer here]")
print()

# Operation 3: Find students who like basketball but NOT soccer (difference)
# Write your code below:
# basketball_not_soccer =

print("DIFFERENCE (-)")
print("Students who like basketball but NOT soccer: [Your answer here]")
print()

# Operation 4: Find students who like exactly ONE of basketball or soccer (symmetric difference)
# Write your code below:
# exactly_one =

print("SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE (△)")
print("Students who like exactly ONE of basketball or soccer (not both): [Your answer here]")
print()
